As you'll see in the pdf :
- 2 blocks on the screen, 1 click on the + of a line in the left block ( product list ) allows you to add a product in the right block ( cart ).
- You have to calculate the quantities and the price for each product and for the total cart as soon as the cart change.
- Products on the right block can be deleted with a click on the button "empty" ( all products erased ) or on the click on the red cross of each product line.
- The product list must be read from the file prods.json

You can use any Javascript library, the important thing is for me to be able to see to the maximum your code and your applicative logic.

In bonus, if you can, serve me the application from node.js and/or one of its frameworks, and load prods.json in an asynchronous way from the server.
